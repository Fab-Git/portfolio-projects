# Stock Market Analysis of Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, and S&P 500 (2018-2023)

## Introduction to the Stock Market and S&P 500
The stock market is a platform where investors buy and sell shares of publicly traded companies. It plays a critical role in the global economy by providing companies with access to capital for growth and offering investors opportunities to share in business profits.

One of the most important measures of the U.S. stock market’s performance is the **S&P 500 index**, which tracks the stock prices of 500 of the largest companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges, including major corporations like Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla. The S&P 500 is widely used by investors as a benchmark to gauge the overall health and performance of the U.S. economy.

Understanding the S&P 500 allows investors to compare individual stock performances, such as those of Microsoft, Apple, or Tesla, against the broader market. This project uses the S&P 500 as a key point of comparison to evaluate the stock price trends of Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla from 2018 to 2023.
